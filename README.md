Mini sequencer
==============

A plaything using the HTML5 audio element to create loops. Mainly
built as a plaything in the leadup to [js13k](http://js13kgames.com).

Notes
-----

* This just uses setTimeout which can be unreliable, particularly
  when you lose focus.
* This should probably use the Web Audio API instead.
* The sample uses jsfxr to render out sounds, but you could just
  as easily use vorbis or whatever your browser supports.

Usage
-----
For usage, see `sample.js`.
